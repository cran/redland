Version 1.0.17-7

BUG FIXES

* Unit tests have been updated to be compatible with the changes in the
  'testthat' package that were made in development version testthat_0.11.0.9000,
  and will be released to CRAN on 4/4/2016. The updated unit tests pass with both
  the current version of testthat (0.11.0) and the new version (0.11.0.9000).
