Version 1.0.17-8

NEW FEATURES

* For Mac OS X, binary installations no longer require Redland system libraries to be installed,
  as these libraries are now statically linked into the redland package shared library 'redland.so'.
  
BUG FIXES
  
* Fixed an unresolved symbol problem with Windows 32 bit builds under R 3.3.0 (and gcc 4.9.3 tool chain) 

Version 1.0.17-7

BUG FIXES

* Unit tests have been updated to be compatible with the changes in the
  'testthat' package that were made in development version testthat_0.11.0.9000,
  and will be released to CRAN on 4/4/2016. The updated unit tests pass with both
  the current version of testthat (0.11.0) and the new version (0.11.0.9000).
